# Experiment No: 1a Python Basics- Printing Multiline String

## AIM  
To create a Python program to print the string in multiple lines using triple quotes.

## ALGORITHM  

1.Begin the program.
2.Use triple quotes (''' or """) to define a string that spans multiple lines.
3.Use the print() function to display the multi-line string.
4.Terminate the program.


## PROGRAM
```python
# Write your code here

string_single_quotes = '''I am a string literal
... has more than one
... line
... placed inside triple single quotes'''

string_double_quotes = """I am a string literal
... has more than one
... line
... placed inside triple double quotes"""

print(string_single_quotes)
print(string_double_quotes)

```
