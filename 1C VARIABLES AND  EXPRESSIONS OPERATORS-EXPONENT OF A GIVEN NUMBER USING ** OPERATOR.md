# Experiment No: 1c-Varibles and Expressions, Operators -  Exponent of a Given Number Using ** Operator in Python

## AIM
To write a Python program that reads two integers from the user and finds the exponent (power) of the first number raised to the second number using the ** operator.

## ALGORITHM
1.Start the program.

2.Read the base number (first integer) from the user and store it in variable a.

3.Read the exponent value (second integer) from the user and store it in variable b.

4.Calculate the result of a raised to the power b using the expression a ** b, and store it in variable c.

5.Print the value of c.

6.End the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
#Write your code here
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c=a**b
print(c)
```
