# Experiment No: 1B- Data Types â€“ character comparision program in python

## AIM  
To write a Python program that reads two characters from the user, compares them using relational operators < and >, and prints the result as True or False.

## ALGORITHM  
1.Start the program.

2.Read the first character from the user and store it in variable a.

3.Read the second character from the user and store it in variable b.

4.Compare if a is less than b and print the result.

5.Compare if a is greater than b and print the result.

6.End the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Write your code here

# Read two characters
a = str(input())
b = str(input())

# Compare and print results
print(a < b)
print(a > b)


```
