# Experiment No: 1a Python Basics- Character Comparison Program in Python

## AIM  
To write a Python program to read two characters from the user, compare them using relational operators (< and >), and print the results (True or False).

## ALGORITHM  
1.Start the program.

2.Read the first input from the user and store it in variable a.

3.Read the second input from the user and store it in variable b.

4.Compare if a is less than b using the < operator and print the result.

5.Compare if a is greater than b using the > operator and print the result.

6.End the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Write your code here

a=str(input())
b=str(input())

print(a<b)
print(a>b)

```

## OUTPUT
